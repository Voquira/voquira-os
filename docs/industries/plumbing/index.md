## Plumbing Operations in Voquira OS

Plumbing operations are reactive, skill-dependent, and time-sensitive.  
Voquira OS models plumbing as a **job-centric, priority-driven service system** built to handle emergencies, diagnostics, and one-off work without sacrificing operational clarity.

This document outlines how Voquira OS supports plumbing businesses.

---

## Core Characteristics of Plumbing Operations

Plumbing differs from recurring field services in key ways:

- High variability in job scope
- Emergency and same-day work
- Skill-based technician assignment
- Diagnostics before execution
- One-time billing is common

Voquira OS treats uncertainty as expected, not exceptional.

---

## Jobs in Plumbing

In plumbing, a Job typically represents a **specific service request**.

Examples:
- Emergency leak repair
- Drain cleaning
- Fixture installation
- Pipe replacement
- Inspection and diagnostics

Jobs are usually **single-execution**, but may expand in scope.

---

## Diagnostics and Scope Expansion

Plumbing Jobs often evolve.

Voquira OS supports:
- Diagnostic phases
- Scope updates
- Job reclassification
- Additional Visits if needed

A Job can be updated without losing auditability or history.

---

## Technician-First Scheduling

Plumbing scheduling is technician-centric.

Scheduling accounts for:
- Skill specialization
- Licensing
- Experience level
- Emergency availability
- Geographic proximity

Jobs are matched to the **right technician**, not just an open time slot.

---

## Priority Handling and Emergencies

Plumbing includes high-urgency work.

Voquira OS supports:
- Priority flags
- SLA-based response expectations
- Dynamic rescheduling
- Interrupt-driven dispatching

Emergency Jobs can preempt existing schedules safely.

---

## Time Windows and Uncertainty

Plumbing Jobs often have:
- Variable duration
- Unknown complexity at creation
- On-site discovery

Scheduling remains flexible, with buffers and real-time updates.

---

## Invoicing and Billing

Common plumbing billing models:
- Time and materials
- Flat-rate services
- Diagnostic fees
- Emergency premiums

Voquira OS decouples **work execution** from **billing logic**, allowing accurate invoicing after scope is confirmed.

---

## Automation Opportunities

Effective plumbing automations include:
- Priority-based dispatching
- Emergency alerts
- Job status updates
- Invoice generation post-completion
- Technician availability tracking

Automation supports responsiveness without removing human judgment.

---

## AI Agents in Plumbing

AI agents assist operations without replacing expertise.

Examples:
- Dispatcher Agent prioritizes incoming Jobs
- Scheduling Agent reallocates work during emergencies
- AR Agent tracks completed Jobs pending invoicing
- Customer Comms Agent sends arrival and completion updates

Agents act on operational signals, not assumptions.

---

## Design Principle

Voquira OS does not force plumbing into recurring models.

Instead:
- Jobs represent intent
- Technicians represent capability
- Scheduling remains adaptive
- Billing reflects reality

---

## Summary

- Plumbing is reactive and skill-dependent
- Jobs are often one-time and urgent
- Scheduling prioritizes expertise and response time
- Diagnostics are part of execution
- Automation enhances speed, not rigidity

Voquira OS treats plumbing as an execution-first operation—not a calendar problem.
